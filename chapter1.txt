In the beginning of the story, Ayechus is introduced as the son of Zeus and the nymph Agina, daughter of the river god Asopus. Despite being a bastard son of Zeus, Ayechus is able to rise to a position of power and becomes the ruler of the island of Egina. However, the goddess Hera, jealous of Zeus's illegitimate children, decides to take revenge on Ayechus by unleashing a terrible plague on the island, killing all of his subjects.

Left desperate and alone, Ayechus turns to his father for help, begging for subjects to populate his empty land. Zeus, moved by his son's plight, uses his divine powers to bring forth a group of ants from an ant hill and transforms them into strong and brave men and women.

These new subjects are trained to become the elite guard known as the Myrmidons, renowned for their loyalty and tireless work ethic. Among the Myrmidons are the fathers of two of the most famous warriors in history: Teleman of Salamis, father of Ajax the Great, and Pelius, father of Achilles.

With the Myrmidons at his side, Ayechus is able to rebuild his kingdom and establish a new era of prosperity on the island of Egina. But the seeds of conflict have been sown, and the stage is set for the epic Trojan War in which the Myrmidons will play a crucial role.
